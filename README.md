# 6502 Computer Build
I built a 6502 computer from scratch and wrote a program for it. The program allows a user to roll an 8 sided-dice by interacting with some peripherals. The program was loaded into the EEPROM manually using an EEPROM programmer I built. Each Assembly command was converted to a hexadecimal equivalent and loaded into individual locations in the program storage as binary.

# Sequencer
Produces a sequencer program that displays a dynamic LED pattern. Users can interact with and change the LED pattern through push buttons. All code is implemented in the PIC Assembly lanuage.
