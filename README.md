## 6502 Computer Build
I built a 6502 computer from scratch and wrote a program for it. The program allows a user to roll an 8 sided-dice by interacting with some peripherals. The program was loaded into the EEPROM manually using an EEPROM programmer I built. Each Assembly command was converted to a hexadecimal equivalent and loaded into individual locations in the program storage as binary. The [6502 Assembly language](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/65c02opcodes.html) was used.

## Sequencer
Produces a sequencer program that displays a dynamic LED pattern. Users can interact with and change the LED pattern through push buttons. All code is implemented in the [PIC Assembly lanuage](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/33014K.pdf).
